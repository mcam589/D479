				<h1 style="font-size:38px;">Welcome to Taniti!</h1>
				<p style="color:blue; padding:10px; font-size:25px;">Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area 
				of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky 
				beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior 
				that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. 
				Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or 
				agriculture. Taniti currently has 10 restaurants: five serve mostly local fish and rice, 
				three serve American-style meals, and two serve Pan-Asian cuisine. Taniti also has two supermarkets,
				two smaller grocery stores, and one convenience store that is open 24 hours a day. </p>

			<p style="color:blue; padding:10px; font-size:25px;">Power outlets are 120 volts (the same as in the United States).</p>
			<p style="color:blue; padding:10px; font-size:25px;">Alcohol is not allowed to be served or sold between the hours of midnight and 9:00 
			a.m.</p>
			<p style="color:blue; padding:10px; font-size:25px;">The drinking age on Taniti is 18 and the drinking age is not strictly enforced.</p>
			<p style="color:blue; padding:10px; font-size:25px;">Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is spoken in rural 
			areas, especially by the older residents.</p>
			<p style="color:blue; padding:10px; font-size:25px;">There is one hospital and several clinics. The hospital has many multilingual 
			employees.</p>
			<p style="color:blue; padding:10px; font-size:25px;">Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases, there are more 
			reports of pickpocketing and other petty crimes.</p>
			<p style="color:blue; padding:10px; font-size:25px;">Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist attractions 
			and restaurants will be closed on holidays, so visitors should plan accordingly.</p>
			<p style="color:blue; padding:10px; font-size:25px;">Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will also accept 
			euros and yen. Several banks facilitate currency exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.</p>
