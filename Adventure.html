		<h1 style= "text-align:center; color:#fdee00;">There is plenty of Island adventure to be had! Most people 
		visit Taniti to enjoy 
		the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano. You can also spend time in Taniti City, 
		which boasts native architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. However, 
		there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, 
		snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter 
		rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be 
		operational by next year. Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly 
		developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay. </h1>
